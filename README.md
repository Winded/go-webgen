# go-webgen

go-webgen is a general-purpose static website generator. You can use Go's templating engine to generate static web pages that you can host with a standard web server, such as nginx. Webgen automatically loads templates from a given template directory.

Additionally, webgen supports mapping static files with hashes in their names, as well as generating gzip compressed versions of these files.
